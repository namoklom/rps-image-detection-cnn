## Project Overview üìñ

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify images of hand gestures representing Rock, Scissors, and Paper. It uses a dataset of 8,774 labeled images and applies image preprocessing, augmentation, and deep learning to accurately recognize these gestures.

The model can be applied to interactive games, gesture recognition systems, and educational tools requiring real-time hand gesture classification.

## Dataset üìÇ

The dataset contains 8,774 images categorized into three classes:

- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors

Images are sourced from the [Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip).

## üß™ Model Testing with Uploaded Images

### Processing Uploaded Testing Images

In this step, we prepare and process new images to test the trained model. Images can be uploaded using Google Colab's built-in upload interface:

After uploading, images must be preprocessed to match the model's input format:

- Resize to 150x150 pixels
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]

### Making Predictions with the Model
```python
predictions = model.predict(processed_image)
predicted_class_index = np.argmax(predictions[0])

class_labels = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

predicted_class = class_labels[predicted_class_index]
print(f'Predicted class: {predicted_class}')
```
